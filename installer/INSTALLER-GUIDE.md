# HandsOff PKG Installer Guide

## The Problem We're Solving

HandsOff Tray App requires a secret passphrase to unlock when input is locked. The app reads this passphrase from the `HANDS_OFF_SECRET_PHRASE` environment variable.

**The Challenge**: When you double-click a macOS .app bundle (from Finder, Spotlight, or Login Items), it does **NOT** inherit environment variables from your shell (`.zshrc`, `.bash_profile`, etc.). This is because macOS launches GUI applications through `launchd`, which has its own minimal environment that doesn't read shell configuration files.

## The Solution: PKG Installer with Launch Agent

We've created an automated installer package (.pkg) that:
1. Installs HandsOff.app to /Applications
2. Includes a setup script that prompts for your passphrase
3. Creates a Launch Agent plist with the passphrase as an environment variable
4. Configures the app to start automatically at login with the correct environment

## Building the Installer

### Quick Start

```bash
make pkg
```

This creates: `dist/HandsOff-v{VERSION}.pkg`

### What Happens During Build

1. **Builds the app bundle** (`make fix-plist`)
2. **Copies setup script** into the app bundle at:
   - `HandsOff.app/Contents/MacOS/setup-launch-agent.sh`
3. **Creates component package** with pkgbuild:
   - Includes the .app bundle
   - Includes postinstall script
4. **Creates final .pkg** with productbuild:
   - Adds welcome/license/conclusion screens
   - Professional installer UI

## End-User Installation Experience

### Step 1: Run the Installer

User double-clicks `HandsOff-v{VERSION}.pkg`

The installer shows:
- **Welcome screen** - Overview of what will be installed
- **License** - Shows LICENSE file
- **Installation** - Installs to /Applications
- **Postinstall script runs** - Checks if Launch Agent already configured
- **Conclusion screen** - Instructions for completing setup

### Step 2: Complete Setup

After installation, the user opens Terminal and runs:

```bash
/Applications/HandsOff.app/Contents/MacOS/setup-launch-agent.sh
```

The script:
1. Prompts for passphrase (with confirmation)
2. Creates `~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.handsoff.inputlock.plist`
3. Loads the Launch Agent
4. Starts HandsOff immediately

### Step 3: Automatic Startup

From now on:
- HandsOff starts automatically at login
- The Launch Agent provides the passphrase via environment variable
- No need to launch from terminal or set shell environment variables
- User never needs to click the app in /Applications

## How It Works: The Launch Agent

The setup script creates a Launch Agent plist at:
```
~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.handsoff.inputlock.plist
```

This plist contains:

```xml
<key>ProgramArguments</key>
<array>
    <string>/Applications/HandsOff.app/Contents/MacOS/handsoff</string>
</array>

<key>EnvironmentVariables</key>
<dict>
    <key>HANDS_OFF_SECRET_PHRASE</key>
    <string>user-passphrase-here</string>
</dict>

<key>RunAtLoad</key>
<true/>
```

**Key points:**
- `ProgramArguments`: Path to the actual executable (not the .app bundle)
- `EnvironmentVariables`: Sets `HANDS_OFF_SECRET_PHRASE` for the launched process
- `RunAtLoad`: Automatically starts at login

When macOS boots up or the user logs in:
1. `launchd` reads all plists in `~/Library/LaunchAgents/`
2. `launchd` launches the HandsOff executable with the specified environment variables
3. The app runs in the background (menu bar only, no Dock icon)

## Files Created by the Installer

```
installer/
├── README.md                    # Detailed documentation
├── build-pkg.sh                 # Main build script
└── scripts/
    ├── postinstall              # Runs after .pkg installation
    └── setup-launch-agent.sh    # User runs to configure passphrase
```

**Generated during build (cleaned up after):**
- `installer/pkg-root/` - Staging directory for package contents
- `installer/HandsOff-component.pkg` - Component package
- `installer/distribution.xml` - Package metadata
- `installer/welcome.html` - Welcome screen HTML
- `installer/conclusion.html` - Conclusion screen HTML

## Important: Don't Click the App!

Once the Launch Agent is configured, users should **NOT** double-click the app in /Applications. Here's why:

| Launch Method | Has Environment Variables? | Result |
|---------------|---------------------------|--------|
| Double-click in Finder | ❌ No | Shows error dialog |
| Launch via Spotlight | ❌ No | Shows error dialog |
| Login Items | ❌ No | Shows error dialog |
| **Launch Agent (plist)** | ✅ **Yes** | **Works correctly** |

The Launch Agent **is** the proper launch mechanism. The .app in /Applications is just the binary that the Launch Agent references.

## Comparison to Other Approaches

### ❌ Setting in .zshrc
```bash
export HANDS_OFF_SECRET_PHRASE='my-passphrase'
```
**Problem**: GUI apps don't inherit shell environment variables

### ❌ Keychain Storage
**Problem**: Prompts for Keychain password every time (annoying)

### ❌ UserDefaults
**Problem**: Stores passphrase in plain text, easily readable by any process

### ✅ Launch Agent with Environment Variables (Our Solution)
**Benefits**:
- No password prompts
- Passphrase stored in user-only readable file (600 permissions)
- Standard macOS practice for background apps
- Automatic startup at login
- No code changes needed

## Security Considerations

1. **Passphrase Storage**:
   - Stored in `~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.handsoff.inputlock.plist`
   - File permissions: 600 (user read/write only)
   - Same security level as storing in a shell script

2. **Who Can Read It?**:
   - Only your user account
   - Root user (like any file on your system)
   - Processes running as your user (same as environment variables)

3. **Is This Secure Enough?**:
   - For personal use: Yes
   - For enterprise: Consider additional security layers
   - More secure than plain text in UserDefaults
   - Less annoying than Keychain prompts

## Makefile Integration

The PKG installer is integrated into the Makefile:

```bash
make pkg     # Build the .pkg installer
make clean   # Removes intermediate files
make help    # Shows all available targets
```

## Testing the Installer

### Build and Test Locally

```bash
# Build the installer
make pkg

# Open it (runs the installer)
open dist/HandsOff-v{VERSION}.pkg

# Follow the installer, then complete setup:
/Applications/HandsOff.app/Contents/MacOS/setup-launch-agent.sh

# Verify it's running:
launchctl list | grep handsoff

# Check logs if there are issues:
cat ~/Library/Logs/HandsOff.log
```

### Inspect Package Contents

```bash
# List all files in the package
pkgutil --payload-files dist/HandsOff-v{VERSION}.pkg

# Verify setup script is included
pkgutil --payload-files dist/HandsOff-v{VERSION}.pkg | grep setup-launch-agent

# Check package signature
pkgutil --check-signature dist/HandsOff-v{VERSION}.pkg

# Expand for detailed inspection
pkgutil --expand dist/HandsOff-v{VERSION}.pkg /tmp/pkg-inspect
```

## Uninstalling

To completely remove HandsOff:

```bash
# Stop and remove Launch Agent
launchctl unload ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.handsoff.inputlock.plist
rm ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.handsoff.inputlock.plist

# Remove app
rm -rf /Applications/HandsOff.app

# Optional: Remove logs
rm ~/Library/Logs/HandsOff.log
rm ~/Library/Logs/HandsOff.error.log
```

## Distribution

### For Personal Use

The unsigned .pkg works fine for personal use:

```bash
make pkg
# Share dist/HandsOff-v{VERSION}.pkg
```

### For Public Distribution

Sign with a Developer ID certificate:

```bash
# Build the package
make pkg

# Sign the package
productsign --sign "Developer ID Installer: Your Name (TEAM_ID)" \
  dist/HandsOff-v{VERSION}.pkg \
  dist/HandsOff-v{VERSION}-signed.pkg

# Notarize for Gatekeeper
xcrun notarytool submit dist/HandsOff-v{VERSION}-signed.pkg \
  --apple-id "your@email.com" \
  --password "app-specific-password" \
  --team-id "TEAM_ID" \
  --wait

# Staple the notarization ticket
xcrun stapler staple dist/HandsOff-v{VERSION}-signed.pkg
```

## Troubleshooting

### Setup script not found after installation

Check if the script exists:
```bash
ls -la /Applications/HandsOff.app/Contents/MacOS/setup-launch-agent.sh
```

If missing, rebuild the package:
```bash
make clean
make pkg
```

### Launch Agent not starting

Check if plist was created:
```bash
ls -la ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.handsoff.inputlock.plist
```

Check if it's loaded:
```bash
launchctl list | grep handsoff
```

View error logs:
```bash
cat ~/Library/Logs/HandsOff.error.log
```

### App shows "passphrase not set" error

This means the app was launched WITHOUT the Launch Agent (e.g., by double-clicking in Finder).

**Solution**: Let the Launch Agent handle launching. Don't click the app manually.

To restart via Launch Agent:
```bash
launchctl unload ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.handsoff.inputlock.plist
launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.handsoff.inputlock.plist
```

## Summary

The PKG installer provides a complete, automated solution for distributing HandsOff with proper environment variable configuration. It solves the fundamental problem that macOS GUI apps don't inherit shell environment variables by using a Launch Agent to provide the passphrase at launch time.

This is the **recommended distribution method** for HandsOff.
