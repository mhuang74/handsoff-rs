# HandsOff - macOS Input Lock

A macOS menu bar application that prevents accidental or unsolicited input from keyboard, trackpad, and mouse devices during video conferencing, presentations, or when leaving your laptop unattended.

## Features

- **Complete Input Blocking**: Blocks all keyboard, trackpad, and mouse inputs while keeping the screen visible
- **Secure Unlocking**: Unlock via passphrase or Touch ID
- **Auto-Lock**: Automatically locks after 3 minutes of inactivity (configurable)
- **Smart Buffer Reset**: 5-second input buffer reset to handle accidental input
- **Hotkeys**:
  - `Ctrl+Cmd+Shift+L`: Enable lock
  - `Ctrl+Cmd+Shift+T`: Talk hotkey (spacebar passthrough for unmuting)
  - `Ctrl+Cmd+Shift+U`: Trigger Touch ID unlock
- **Microphone & Camera**: Video conferencing apps continue to work normally
- **Menu Bar Interface**: Unobtrusive menu bar icon showing lock status (ðŸ”“/ðŸ”’)

## Requirements

- macOS 10.11 (El Capitan) or later
- Rust toolchain (for building from source)
- Accessibility permissions (granted on first run)

## Building

```bash
# Clone the repository
cd handsoff-rs

# Build the project
cargo build --release

# The binary will be at: target/release/handsoff
```

For Apple Silicon Macs:
```bash
cargo build --release --target aarch64-apple-darwin
```

For Intel Macs:
```bash
cargo build --release --target x86_64-apple-darwin
```

## Installation

1. Build the project using the commands above
2. Copy the binary to your Applications folder or preferred location
3. Run the app - you'll be prompted to grant Accessibility permissions
4. Go to System Settings > Privacy & Security > Accessibility
5. Add HandsOff to the list of allowed apps
6. Restart HandsOff

## Usage

### First Run

On first launch, you'll be prompted to set a passphrase. This passphrase will be used to unlock the input when locked.

### Locking Input

You can lock input in two ways:
1. Click the menu bar icon (ðŸ”“) and select "Enable Lock"
2. Press `Ctrl+Cmd+Shift+L` (default hotkey)

When locked, the menu bar icon changes to ðŸ”’ and all keyboard/mouse/trackpad input is blocked.

### Unlocking Input

Three ways to unlock:
1. **Passphrase**: Type your passphrase on the keyboard (even though you can't see the input)
2. **Touch ID**: Press `Ctrl+Cmd+Shift+U` to trigger Touch ID authentication
3. **Wait**: If you accidentally type gibberish, wait 5 seconds for the buffer to reset, then try again

### Auto-Lock

The app automatically locks after 3 minutes of no input activity. You can configure this timeout in the keychain settings.

### Talk Hotkey

When locked, press `Ctrl+Cmd+Shift+T` to temporarily pass through a spacebar keypress, allowing you to unmute in video conferencing apps like Zoom or Google Meet.

## Security

- Passphrases are stored as SHA-256 hashes in macOS Keychain
- Touch ID uses macOS's secure enclave
- No network connections or telemetry
- All data stays on your device

## Compatibility

- Tested on macOS 10.11 (El Capitan) through macOS 14 (Sonoma)
- Works on both Intel and Apple Silicon Macs
- Touch ID requires macOS 10.12.2+ and compatible hardware

## Troubleshooting

### App doesn't block input
- Ensure Accessibility permissions are granted in System Settings > Privacy & Security > Accessibility
- Restart the app after granting permissions

### Touch ID doesn't work
- Touch ID requires macOS 10.12.2+ and compatible hardware (MacBook Pro 2016+)
- Fall back to passphrase entry if Touch ID is unavailable

### Forgot passphrase
- Quit the app (when unlocked)
- Remove the keychain entry: `security delete-generic-password -s com.handsoff.inputlock -a passphrase_hash`
- Restart the app and set a new passphrase
