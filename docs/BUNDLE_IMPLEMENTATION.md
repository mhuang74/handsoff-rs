# macOS App Bundle Implementation Summary

This document summarizes the implementation of the macOS application bundle for HandsOff, following the specification in `specs/build_as_macos_app.md`.

## Implementation Status: ✅ Complete

All requirements from the specification have been successfully implemented.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. cargo-bundle Installation
- ✅ Installed `cargo-bundle` v0.9.0
- ✅ Verified installation and functionality

### 2. Cargo.toml Configuration
- ✅ Added complete `[package.metadata.bundle]` section with:
  - Application metadata (name, identifier, version, copyright)
  - Description and category
  - macOS-specific settings (minimum OS version, frameworks)
  - Reference to custom Info.plist template

### 3. Info.plist Template
- ✅ Created `Info.plist.template` with placeholders for cargo-bundle
- ✅ Configured critical keys:
  - `LSUIElement: true` - Menu bar only app (no Dock icon)
  - `NSHighResolutionCapable: true` - Retina display support
  - `LSMinimumSystemVersion: 10.11` - Minimum macOS version

### 4. Assets Directory
- ✅ Created `assets/` directory structure
- ✅ Added `assets/README.md` with instructions for creating app icons

### 5. Build Automation
- ✅ Created comprehensive `Makefile` with targets:
  - `build` - Build release binary
  - `bundle` - Create .app bundle
  - `fix-plist` - Apply Info.plist fixes for LSUIElement
  - `sign` - Code sign the application
  - `dmg` - Create DMG installer
  - `install` - Install to /Applications
  - `test`, `check`, `clippy` - Development tools
  - `clean` - Remove build artifacts
  - `help` - Show available targets

### 6. Helper Scripts
- ✅ Info.plist fixes integrated into Makefile targets
- ✅ All build automation handled through Makefile

### 7. Documentation
- ✅ Created `BUILD.md` with comprehensive build instructions
- ✅ Documented all build processes, verification steps, and troubleshooting
- ✅ Included signing and notarization guidance

### 8. Version Control
- ✅ Updated `.gitignore` to exclude build artifacts:
  - `dist/` - DMG output directory
  - `dmg-contents/` - Temporary DMG assembly directory
  - `.DS_Store` - macOS metadata files

### 9. Code Cleanup
- ✅ Removed unused `#[macro_use]` warning in `src/main.rs`
- ✅ Verified clean build with no warnings

## Bundle Structure

The created bundle has the correct macOS application structure:

```
HandsOff.app/
└── Contents/
    ├── Info.plist           # App metadata with LSUIElement
    └── MacOS/
        └── handsoff         # ARM64 executable
```

## Key Info.plist Settings

The final bundle includes these critical settings:

```xml
CFBundleExecutable: handsoff
CFBundleIdentifier: com.handsoff.inputlock
CFBundleName: HandsOff
CFBundleDisplayName: HandsOff
CFBundleVersion: 0.1.0
LSUIElement: true              ← Menu bar only, no Dock icon
NSHighResolutionCapable: true  ← Retina display support
LSMinimumSystemVersion: 10.11
```

## Build Workflow

### Quick Build (Recommended)
```bash
make all
```

This runs: build → bundle → fix-plist

### Create Distribution Package
```bash
make dmg
```

This runs: build → bundle → fix-plist → ad-hoc sign → create DMG

Output: `dist/HandsOff-v{VERSION}-<arch>.dmg`

### Install Locally
```bash
make install
```

Installs to: `/Applications/HandsOff.app`

## Verification

All verification steps passed:

- ✅ Bundle structure is correct
- ✅ Info.plist is valid (`plutil -lint`)
- ✅ LSUIElement key is present
- ✅ Double-clicking launches app without Terminal
- ✅ No Dock icon appears (menu bar only)
- ✅ Menu bar icon displays correctly
- ✅ Executable permissions correct
- ✅ Binary architecture: ARM64
- ✅ DMG creation successful

## Files Created

### Configuration Files
- `Cargo.toml` - Updated with bundle metadata
- `Info.plist.template` - Custom plist template
- `Makefile` - Build automation

### Documentation
- `BUILD.md` - Build instructions
- `BUNDLE_IMPLEMENTATION.md` - This file
- `assets/README.md` - Icon creation guide

### Build Artifacts (gitignored)
- `target/release/bundle/osx/HandsOff.app/` - Application bundle
- `dist/HandsOff-v0.1.0.dmg` - DMG installer

## Known Issues and Workarounds

### Issue: LSUIElement Not Applied by cargo-bundle

**Problem**: cargo-bundle v0.9.0 doesn't support the `LSUIElement` key in Info.plist templates with placeholders.

**Workaround**: The Makefile's `fix-plist` target uses `plutil` to add the key post-build:
```bash
plutil -insert LSUIElement -bool true HandsOff.app/Contents/Info.plist
```

This is automatically handled by:
- `make all`
- `make fix-plist`
- `make dmg`
- `make install`

## Future Enhancements

Items not implemented (from spec, marked as optional):

- [ ] Application icon (.icns file)
- [ ] Universal binary (ARM64 + x86_64)
- [ ] Distribution signing with Developer ID
- [ ] Notarization for Gatekeeper
- [ ] GitHub Actions workflow
- [ ] Homebrew Cask formula
- [ ] Sparkle auto-update integration

See `specs/build_as_macos_app.md` for implementation details if needed.

## Testing Checklist

All core functionality verified:

- [x] Bundle structure is correct
- [x] Double-clicking opens app without Terminal
- [x] Menu bar icon appears (🔓/🔒)
- [x] No Dock icon appears (LSUIElement working)
- [x] App can be quit and reopened
- [x] DMG creation works
- [x] Makefile targets all work correctly

## Summary

The HandsOff application is now properly packaged as a native macOS application bundle that:

1. Launches as a proper macOS app (not via Terminal)
2. Appears as a menu bar-only application (no Dock icon)
3. Integrates correctly with macOS UI conventions
4. Can be easily distributed via DMG
5. Has a streamlined build process via Makefile

Users can now:
- Build with: `make`
- Create the distributable disk image with: `make dmg`
- Install locally with: `make install`
- Distribute: `dist/HandsOff-v{VERSION}-<arch>.dmg`
