## Safety Features for Development

See `docs/SAFE-DEVELOPMENT.md` for complete safety guide. Key strategies:

### ⚡ Quick Start - Safest Development Setup

1. **Enable SSH** (MOST IMPORTANT)
   ```bash
   # On your Mac
   sudo systemsetup -setremotelogin on

   # Test from phone/another computer
   ssh you@your-mac.local
   pkill handsoff  # This can save you if locked out
   ```

2. **Use Development Mode** (auto-unlock after 10 seconds)
   ```bash
   HANDSOFF_DEV_MODE=1 cargo run
   ```

3. **Start with Dry Run** (logs only, doesn't block)
   ```bash
   HANDSOFF_DEV_MODE=1 HANDSOFF_DRY_RUN=1 cargo run
   ```

4. **Test Incrementally**
   ```bash
   # Test mouse blocking first (keyboard still works!)
   HANDSOFF_DEV_MODE=1 BLOCK_MOUSE=1 cargo run

   # Then test keyboard blocking
   HANDSOFF_DEV_MODE=1 BLOCK_KEYBOARD=1 cargo run

   # Finally test both together
   HANDSOFF_DEV_MODE=1 BLOCK_KEYBOARD=1 BLOCK_MOUSE=1 cargo run
   ```

### 🚨 If You Get Locked Out

**Option 1**: Wait 10 seconds (if dev mode enabled)

**Option 2**: SSH from another device and kill the process
```bash
ssh you@your-mac.local
pkill handsoff
```

**Option 3**: Force restart Mac (hold power button - LAST RESORT)

## What Can Be Unit Tested vs What Requires Manual Testing

### ✅ Unit Testable (Automated)
- Passphrase hashing and verification
- Keycode to character conversion
- State management logic
- Buffer operations and timing
- Auto-lock logic and timing
- Thread safety

### ⚠️ Integration Testing Required (Semi-automated)
- Keychain read/write operations
- Hotkey registration and detection
- Settings persistence

### ❌ Manual Testing Only (Cannot Automate)
- Event tap actually blocking input
- Menu bar UI interaction
- Touch ID fingerprint authentication
- Notification display and appearance
- Full-screen overlay visibility
- Video conferencing compatibility (Zoom, Meet, etc.)
- Multi-monitor behavior
- External keyboard/mouse blocking

## Manual Testing Checklist

See `specs/phase-2.md` for complete manual testing procedures. Key areas:

### Critical Manual Tests (Before Each Release)

#### Lock/Unlock Flow
- [ ] Set passphrase via UI
- [ ] Enable lock via menu
- [ ] Enable lock via hotkey (Ctrl+Cmd+Shift+L)
- [ ] Verify keyboard is blocked
- [ ] Verify mouse is blocked
- [ ] Verify trackpad is blocked
- [ ] Enter incorrect passphrase (should stay locked)
- [ ] Enter gibberish, wait 5 seconds, enter correct passphrase
- [ ] Unlock with Touch ID (Ctrl+Cmd+Shift+U)
- [ ] Verify unlock notification is visible

#### Video Conferencing
- [ ] Join Zoom/Google Meet call
- [ ] Enable lock during call
- [ ] Verify video continues
- [ ] Verify audio continues
- [ ] Test Talk hotkey (Ctrl+Cmd+Shift+T + Spacebar)
- [ ] Verify unlock notification visible during call

#### Auto-Lock
- [ ] Set short timeout (30 seconds)
- [ ] Idle for timeout period
- [ ] Verify lock engages automatically
- [ ] Move mouse - verify timer resets
- [ ] Press key - verify timer resets

#### Edge Cases
- [ ] Test with external keyboard
- [ ] Test with external mouse
- [ ] Test with external trackpad
- [ ] Test with multiple displays
- [ ] Test accessibility permissions denied
- [ ] Test app restart after force quit

## CI/CD Recommendations

For continuous integration pipelines:

```yaml
# GitHub Actions example
- name: Run tests
  run: cargo test --all-features

- name: Run clippy
  run: cargo clippy -- -D warnings

- name: Check formatting
  run: cargo fmt -- --check

- name: Build release
  run: cargo build --release
```

**Note**: Integration tests requiring Accessibility permissions should be run manually or in a dedicated test environment.

---

## Next Steps

1. **Add keychain integration tests** (Phase 2)
   - Mock keychain for testing
   - Test store/retrieve operations
   - Test error handling

2. **Add hotkey manager tests** (Phase 2)
   - Test registration logic
   - Test custom hotkey parsing
   - Test conflict detection

3. **Add settings persistence tests** (Phase 2)
   - Test timeout configuration
   - Test hotkey configuration
   - Test passthrough key selection

4. **Performance benchmarks** (Future)
   - Event tap callback latency
   - Passphrase verification speed
   - Buffer operations performance

5. **Fuzzing tests** (Future)
   - Random keycode input
   - Random passphrase strings
   - Stress test state transitions

- [ ] Tests are fast (< 1 second each)
- [ ] Tests have clear names describing what they test
- [ ] Edge cases are covered
- [ ] Error conditions are tested
- [ ] Thread safety is verified for concurrent code
